# Mechanical Design

The inspiration for this course at Windsor High School is actually a course in the Engineering College at Colorado State Unversity called <a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/~dga/courses/mech307/" target ="_blank">Mechatronics and Measurement Systems</a>.  That course is meant to be one of the capstone courses in the mechanical engineering degree at CSU.  In order to complete our capstone project, we will all need to have a solid understanding of the parts of a mechatronic or robotic system.

## Parts of a Robotic System

We need to be able to determine what components will be necessary in our robot design.  To do this, an overview of the various part types is necessary.  We will define the numerous mechanisms that may be used in our designs as well as the component systems that make a robot.  At the end of this chapter, you will create a design on <a href="https://www.onshape.com/" target ="_blank">OnShape</a> which will serve as the basis for your capstone project next semester.  Use this as an opportunity to start thinking about what you will do in creating a robotic system.

<u>Steps to prepare for this work</u>
<ol>
  <li>Start thinking about a problem you might like to solve.  Is there something at home that could be improved?  For example, last year I built a solar powered Raspberry Pi controlled garden watering system.  Something like that has a definite use and provides a solution for my wife and I.  Now that it works, when we go on vacation we don't worry that our garden gets watered.</li>

</figure>
</p>
  <li>Look for other examples.  A good place to start is the <a href="https://video-demos.colostate.edu/robotics-controls/mechatronics/projects/" target ="_blank">Student Examples from the MECH 307 Course at CSU</a>.  Another good source is <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/category/4" target ="_blank">SparkFun Projects Examples</a>.  In additon, there are many websites that have Raspberry Pi ideas.</li>
  <li>Think about what makes you excited to do this project.  What would you have fun doing for four months next semester?</li>
</ol>  

Write down some ideas so that, you may come back to them later as you learn more

Now that we have some ideas, let's learn about the various types of parts available to us.

### Power Supply

A major consideration is power.  Most of the systems we design need to be efficient in their use of power.  We are not always able to connect to an outlet.  For example, home surveillance cameras are small and easy to install in many different locations.  However, if we had to connect them to an AC power source, the list of possible locations for installation could be greatly reduced.  The solution is a battery pack.  How do we decide which battery though?  A surveillance camera might need to run for weeks at a time without changing the battery.  As a result, a high quality lithium ion source would probably make the most sense.  The drawback to this compact and powerful design is, of course, price.  These are the types of trade-offs we must consider.

<u>Power Supplies include:</u>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Power-Supply-Adapter-Charger/dp/B0719SX3GC/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-drs1_0?cv_ct_cx=raspberry+pi+power+supply&dchild=1&keywords=raspberry+pi+power+supply&pd_rd_i=B0719SX3GC&pd_rd_r=cfe19aaa-1ab3-4e25-a2bb-71db90ddbdd2&pd_rd_w=UmEqs&pd_rd_wg=lWUzP&pf_rd_p=055f7364-94db-4b93-80d6-346300592c66&pf_rd_r=TX0AEE71D4WXCBYK3ZSB&psc=1&qid=1595873393&sr=1-1-f7123c3d-6c2e-4dbe-9d7a-6185fb77bc58" target ="_blank">DC Wall adapters</a></li>
  <li><a hfer ="https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Holder-Barrel-Connector-Arduino/dp/B07T65WWCR/ref=sr_1_4?crid=SN27799GVMQI&dchild=1&keywords=aa+battery+pack+arduino&qid=1595873477&s=electronics&sprefix=aa+battery+pack+ardui%2Celectronics%2C177&sr=1-4" target ="_blank">Battery packs for rechargable NiMH batteries</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.robotshop.com/en/nimh-2000mah-battery-pack-hitec-connector.html" target ="_blank">Pre-built battery packs</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adafruit-Medium-Volt-Solar-Panel/dp/B01BKA1YSK" target = "_blank">Solar panels</a></li>
</ul>

As we see, there are many options and considerations.  Only by determining total power needs, space and weight constraints and budget can we select the correct source.  For now, consider power needs first.  As you get closer to the start of your project you can narrow down your choices.

### Actuators

Most robots move and interact with the physical world.  We will not make that distinction here although there are many who believe that this is a requirement.  A robotic car system has many actuation systems.  The most notable of these is the drive system.  Through the wheels and transmission the motor interacts with the surface the robot is on to propel the robot.  Any device creating motion in this way is an actuator.  Like power supplies, actuator selection meets many criteria.  A look at the <a href="https://www.robotshop.com/en/motors-actuators.html" target =_blank">RobotShop Actuator Page</a> reveals hundreds of possibilities.

<ul>
  <li>DC Motors</li>
  <li>Stepper Motors</li>
  <li>Servos</li>
  <li>Linear Slides</li>
</ul>

From these fours types of actuators, most robotic systems may develop a way of interacting with the environment.

### Sensors

There are even more sensor types than there are actuator types.  If we browse the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/35" target ="_blank">Adafruit Sensor Page</a> we see how limitless these possibilities are.  For any type of sensor application there is, someone has though of a way to build it.

As <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rasc/Download/AMRobots4.pdf" target = "_blank">excerpt from a robotics text</a> explains, sensors are either proprioceptive or exteroceptive and, at the same time, either passive or active.  This chart is taken from that text:

</figure>
</p>


### Microprocessors

For most students, the Raspberry Pi will function as the microprocessor for the course.  Students learn to interact with the Pi using the command line and Python.  In addition, the Raspberry Pi offers many advantages over other microprocessors like Arduinos.  One of the main advantages is the built in wifi capabilities.  This allows for remote programming and true Internet of Things (IoT) capabilites.  Still, some may choose a different processor, maybe even a different version of the Pi.

A <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/" target ="_blank">Raspberry Pi Zero W</a> is an extremely compact and low cost alternative to the Rapberry Pi 3 we use in class.  It is made for low-power, compact IoT applicaitons and should be considered.  While the processor speed is slower than larger Pis, it might be just the fit for your project.  Compact versions of other processors are available as well.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_single-board_microcontrollers" target ="_blank">This list</a> is quite extensive and should be considered.

### Structural Parts

The skeleton of the robotic system determines the physical constraints on the design.  For years now, our robotics team has dealth with this issue.  Several years ago they were presented with a challenge in the competition which required their robot to climb a mountain:

<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cmpHSRe6rGTt-MiIm45DNvdX5LnQPqjeFoMLTcRDMEe-jTS-R-VCHQpOXHaIDewV3isya2OqOclK3ttuJrw_SZFTdhtLex9lYP1k0KlGzc5bqn2ezhGXwOkCdMWfAII_uaL7MYbPUcI6blbrHRMNBy=w787-h904-no?authuser=0" alt="Climbing a mountain" style="width:80%">
  <figcaption><b><i>Fig. 4.2 - WHS Robotics Team members analyze the challenge in the 2015 season.</b></i></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

As we can see from the photograph, the mountain was quite daunting.  The previous year, the team had advanced to the world championships and found that their robot, while the best design in Colorado, was not suited to compete with the heavier robots beyond the state.  As a result they had been pushed around a bit and not been very successful.  The solution to this was to weld a steel frame together and build the robot off of that.  The result was a 70 pound robot!  Without thinking more deeply about the design of the current year, they had hampered themselves by dealing with the previous yesr's challenge in mind.  The robot was robust and strong but could not climb the mountain.  Instead, every tread system they tried to use to climb was under so much strain that it eventually broke.  They would even 3D print treads made out of high strength plastics that still could not hold up to the strain.  In this case, the structural parts let them down.  What a great learning experience that was.  All three of those students in the photo are in science and engineering programs currently in college.  The one on the right, Mitchell Watson, is literally going to be a rocket scientist when he graduates for Cal Tech.  Understanding these concepts of mechanical design are not only fundamental to robotics, they can lead to many great opportunities.

There are many options for structural parts.  Over the years, we have accumulated a wealth of parts in our program which may be checked out.  In addition, we have plenty of scrap material (we hated that mountain so much that we cut it up at the end of the season and have been using it for scrap since then).  After you learn how to use CAD later in this unit, you will be able to design and print your own custom parts as well.  

The type of material matters.  Begin with <a href="https://www.societyofrobots.com/materials.shtml" target="_blank">this materials guide</a> in selecting your parts.  Consider using pre-built kits or components.  Here is a list of companies that provide robotics parts:

<b>Assignment 4.2</b><br>
On graph paper draw a design for your expected capstone project.  You should include at least three different angles for your drawing (two sides and a top).  You should include dimensions and labels of each part.  On a Google spreadsheet, make a list of all parts you think you might need.  In a one-page typed summary describe your design. 

## Mechanisms and Motion

Mechanisms can be used to change the speed, direction or force required to do something. Mechanisms may be able to help you but they cannot do it on their own. 

### Inputs and Outputs

Machines need energy and someone or something to operate them. In mechatronics we utilze actuators attached to a control system for the source of the energy.  The energy that is used by a machine is called the ___input___. The result of this energy input is called the ___output___. While it is not a robotic system, a mechanism such as a bicycle can be explained with the diagram below.

<p>

  <figcaption><b><i>Fig. 4.? - A bicycle as a mechanical system.</b></i></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

### Types of Motion

Mechanisms are concerned with motion. There are four main types of motion. These can be illustrated by means of human body movements.

<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Test-Org/Robotics_Engineering_Book/blob/master/Images/types_motion.png?raw=true" alt="Types of Motion" style="width:70%">
  <figcaption><b><i>Fig. 4.? - Examples of various types of motion.</b></i></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

Motion that is transferred along a line is known as ___linear motion___.  Utilizing this system allows robotic designs to extend reach in all directions but is mainly used in attaining more height or reaching horizontally.  Motion which is a repetitive up-and-down or back-and-forth linear motion is known as ___reciprocating motion___.  This movement is commonly used in pumps.  ___Rotary motion___ is a circular movement of an object around a center (or point) of rotation and is the most commonly used motion in robotic systems.  Drive systems are usually based in rotary motion but other systems utilize it as well including lifting and collecting mechanisms.  Pendulums represent one application of ___oscillating motion___ which are used in robotics systems.

## Levers

One of the oldest mechanisms is the ___lever___. Stone Age people used them to move large objects.

<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Test-Org/Robotics_Engineering_Book/blob/master/Images/stone_age.png?raw=true" alt="Stone age lever" style="width:70%">
  <figcaption><b><i>Fig. 4.? - Using a lever to move a heavy object.</b></i></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

A lever can be described as a long rigid object with a pivot point somewhere along its length. The pivot is a fixed point about which the lever rotates. The pivot is also known as the ___fulcrum___. Levers are used to do two things: they can move a large load with only a little effort, or they can increase or amplify movement. A seesaw is a simple example of a lever.

<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Test-Org/Robotics_Engineering_Book/blob/master/Images/seesaw.png?raw=true" alt="seesaw" style="width:70%">
  <figcaption><b><i>Fig. 4.? - A seesaw is an example of a simple lever.</b></i></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

### Classes and Categories

Levers are classified by the relative positions of the ___fulcrum___ (the point of ___fixed pivot___), ___effort___ (the ___input force___) and ___resistance___ (or ___load___). It is common to call the input force the effort and the output force the load or the resistance. This allows the identification of three classes of levers by the relative locations of the fulcrum, the resistance and the effort.

With a ___Class one lever___, the fulcrum is between the effort and resistance. The effort is applied on one side of the fulcrum and the resistance (or load) on the other side, for example, a seesaw, a crowbar or a pair of scissors, a common balance , a claw hammer. Mechanical advantage may be greater than, less than, or equal to 1.

<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Test-Org/Robotics_Engineering_Book/blob/master/Images/class_1.png?raw=true" alt="class one lever" style="width:70%">
  <figcaption><b><i>Fig. 4.? - A class one lever and example.</b></i></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

A ___class two lever___ places resistance (or load) between the effort and fulcrum. The effort is applied on one side of the resistance and the fulcrum is located on the other side, e.g. in a wheelbarrow, a nutcracker, a bottle opener or the brake pedal of a car, the load arm is smaller than the effort arm, and the mechanical advantage is always greater than one. It is also called force multiplier lever.

<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Test-Org/Robotics_Engineering_Book/blob/master/Images/class_2.png?raw=true" alt="class two lever" style="width:70%">
  <figcaption><b><i>Fig. 4.? - A class two lever and example.</b></i></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

Utilizing a ___class three lever___ places the effort between the fulcrum and resistance. The resistance (or load) is on one side of the effort and the fulcrum is located on the other side, for example, a pair of tweezers, a hammer, a pair of tongs, fishing rod, common balance or the mandible of our skull. The effort arm is smaller than the load arm. Mechanical advantage is always less than 1. It is also called speed multiplier lever.

<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Test-Org/Robotics_Engineering_Book/blob/master/Images/class_3.png?raw=true" alt="class three lever" style="width:70%">
  <figcaption><b><i>Fig. 4.? - A class three lever and example.</b></i></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

### Mechanical Advantage

We use levers every day because they make it is easier to get work done. They give us ___mechanical advantage___ (MA) which means that you can move a large load using a small effort.  The MA in the example below is found by comparing the weight of the load with the effort needed to move it. (Remember 1kg = 10 Newton)

$$MA=(Load/Effort)=400N/100N=4:1 = 4$$

If you look at wheelbarrow example again you will see that the distance the effort has to move is much further that that of the load. By comparing the two distances you get the velocity ratio (VR).

<p>

  <figcaption><b><i>Fig. 4.? - A wheel barrow used to lift a heavy load.</b></i></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

### Efficiency

Mechanisms are not always 100% efficient due to factors such as parts that bend, friction etc.
The scientific formula for the calculation of the efficiency of a mechanism is as follows:

$$Efficiency = (MA/VR)*100\%$$


### Moments

If a seesaw is not moving but remains level, it is said to be balanced. The forces on either side of the fulcrum are equal and opposite. If the force on one end of the seesaw is greater than the other, or if the fulcrum is not in the center, then the seesaw will rotate around the fulcrum. This turning force is known as a ___moment___.

<p>

  <figcaption><b><i>Fig. 4.? - The turning of the seesaw about the fulcrum illustrates a moment.</b></i></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

Moments can be used to work out unknown weights or distances of movement. The figure below shows how to calculate the moment for a very large spanner.

## Rotary Motion

### Drive Systems

### Pulleys, Sprockets and Gears

Pulleys, sprockets and gears are used to transfer rotary motion from one place to another. All are wheels. Pulleys are wheels with grooves in the rims, in which a belt or rope can run. Pulleys can transfer rotary motion from one shaft to another or can be used to lift heavy loads. Gears are wheels with teeth evenly spaced around the rims. Several gears can be placed, so that their teeth interlock, or mesh. When two or more gears are used together, they form what is called a gear train. Gears can be used to change the speed and direction in which something rotates. When chains are used to connect the “gears”, a chain and sprocket system is formed, for example on bicycles and motorcycles. Sprocket systems share properties of both of the other systems.

In figure 4.3 the direction of rotation of the pulleys is opposite to each other. The mechanical advantage is gained by the variation in the size (diameter) of the pulleys.

</figure>
</p>


The illustration below shows gears fixed to parallel shafts, forming a simple gear train. The gear fixed on the drive shaft is called the ___driver gear___ and is connected to the ___driven gear___. The shafts will turn in opposite directions and, because the gears have different sizes, they will turn at different speeds.

<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/WHS-Robotics-Test-Org/Robotics_Engineering_Book/blob/master/Images/gear_systems.png?raw=true" alt="Driver and Driven Gears" style="width:60%">
  <figcaption><b><i>Fig. 4.12 - Driver and Driven Gears in a Simple Gear System.</b></i></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

The difference in their speeds (velocity ratio) can be calculated from the number of teeth on the driver gear (Teeth~1~) compared to the driven gear (Teeth~2~).

$$VR = (Teeth_2/Teeth_1) = (40/20) = 2:1$$
The ___velocity ratio___ (VR) in this example may be expressed as 2:1 (say "two to one") or simply as 2.  This means that in this case the driver shaft must turn twice for the driven shaft to complete one turn.

Similarly, the velocity ratio of a pulley system may be calculated with essentially the same formula.  Pulley systems use a belt to transmit motion and force from the driver shaft to the driven shaft. Cars use a pulley system with V-belts running in grooves on the pulley wheels. Speed changes are made by using different sizes of pulleys on the driver and driven shafts respectively. By comparing the sizes of the two pulleys you can calculate the velocity ratio (VR) of the system.  Instead of using the number of teeth, the difference in pulley speeds can be calculated by comparing the diameter of the driver pulley (Size~1~) to the diameter of the driven pulley (Size~2~).

$$VR = (Size_2/Size_1)=(25/100)=1:4$$
The velocity ration in this example is expressed as 1:4.  This means that one turn of the driver shaft will give four turns of the driven shaft.

Once we know the velocity ratio of the gears we are working with, we can begin to predict ___output speed___ (S~O~) for a given ___input speed___ (S~I~).

$$S_O=(S_I/VR)=(2000rpm/3:1)=6000rpm$$
In this case the velocity ratio is 3:1 and the input speed is 2000 ___revolutions per minute___ (rpm).  The resulting output speed is 6,000 rpm.

### Rack and Pinion Systems

## Computer Aided Design

The concepts learned in this unit require planning and modeling to implement effectively.  It is useful to "tinker" with mechanical parts in order to be able to visualize the system itself.  All engineering, however, includes a significant design element.  In most cases, we need to sketch out our design on a piece of paper or board to give the solution to our problem some conceptual scale.

Once you have your design down on paper, it is time to create it like a real mechatronics engineer.  For this section you will learn to use <a href="https://www.onshape.com/" target ="_blank">OnShape</a>, a modern and full-scale computer aided design (CAD) system.  OnShape was founded by two engineers at SolidWorks which is still considered the gold standard of CAD.  SolidWorks comes with a hefty price tag, even for students.  OnShape is free to secondary schools.  As a result, we will use it.  Once year learn this tool, switching to other CAD software will be relatively painless.  In addition, it is entirely web based so you can use it as long as you have an internet connection and a web browser.

If you have not done so already, head to the [OnShape Account Setup] section of the course book.  Follow those instructions.  After you have done this, log on to your account and follow these instructions:
