Browse through the notes to gain an understanding of what we will be covering this year. Sign up for a GitHub account and fill out this form. Bookmark the course GitHub Repository. This is where many of the programming resources will be found. In addition, assignments will be submitted here. Find the Python textbook for the course. While this course includes more than just programming, we will dedicate quite a bit of time to learning Python. Subscribe to the course YouTube Channel. Directions for how to do this are found in the Follow the Course YouTube Channel section of this site. Log on to the class Jupyter Notebook server Sign up for an OnShape account by following the instructions in the OnShape Account Setup section of this site. Complete the WHS Mechatronics Lab Code of Conduct Agreement. "],
["intro.html", "Section 2 Introduction", " Section 2 Introduction Remember that engineers spend a majority of their time debugging their designs. You will too. It is not because this course is made too hard for you…it is just the way engineering works. “They say that no plan survives first contact with implementation. I’d have to agree.” – Mark Watney, Sol 40 Why begin with this quote? One of my favorite books and movies of all time is The Martian. The struggles of the main character, Mark Whatney, in this work demonstrate the challenges facing engineers. While we will not be risking our lives on another planet, our solutions to the problems of this class follow the same pattern as his. Where he sought to survive being the only human on another planet by engineering his way out, we will survive this course by learning to attack problems in the same way and remember not to give up because no plan will work the first time. During this class students will explore the field of mechatronics using a variety of hands-on activities. Students begin the semester with an introduction to basic history and theory of robotics, the engineering process and tools and processes used to create robotic devices. We will introduce basic electronics concepts. Moving forward programming becomes an essential and vital element. Students program the onboard micro-processor found on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. This control board will use the Raspian OS which is a version of Linux. While students will work within the Linux shell, the programming language of this course is Python. Students work individually and in teams to design and build simple drive trains capable of meeting a variety of criteria including climbing, pushing, attaining maximum speed, etc. Sensors are introduced to allow robotic devices to interact with the environment. Actuator design is discussed and different manipulator designs are introduced. As an essential part of mechanical design, students will be exposed to CAD concepts using OnShape. As you can see from this Euler diagram of Mechatronics is a complicated field of engineering that combines many areas of study. This is the more technical name for robotics and was created by Tetsuro Mori in 1971 and has served as the name for this field since. In this course, you will be introduced to several of the areas on this diagram. Since much of this course will be delivered remotely, be sure that you consider creating a good remote learning environment by doing the following: Create a dedicated workspace for yourself that you can keep neat and organized throughout the year. Pick a place that is as quiet as possible so that you can concentrate. Do not use this space for anything else. In this course that space should include a place for your computer as well as an area to work on electronics projects - preferable with a hard surface like a desktop or workbench. Manage your sleep schedule. You will need to be able to concentrate and stay focused since you do not have a teacher hovering over your workspace to keep you focused. If you go to bed at a consistent time and wake up at a consistent time, you will be able to learn more effectively. Make sure you know how to log on to every account needed for the course. See the Prerequisites for all of the details for this course. Be sure to ask questions if you encounter any difficulties. "],
