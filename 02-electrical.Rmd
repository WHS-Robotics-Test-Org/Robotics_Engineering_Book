# Electrical Concepts

This class and modern life relies heavily on electricity and electronics.  Our course electronics text points this out quite eloquently:

<p><i>The history of electricity starts more than two thousand years ago, with the Greek philosopher Thales being the earliest known researcher into electricity. But it was Alessandro Volta who created the most common DC power source, the battery (for this invention the unit Volt was named after him).</p>
<p>Direct current (also known as DC) is the flow of charged particles in one unchanging direction (most commonly found as electron flow through conductive materials). DC can be found in just about every home and electronic device, as it is more practical (compared to AC from power stations) for many consumer devices. Just a few of the places where you can find direct current are batteries, phones, computers, cars, TVs, calculators, and even lightning.</i></p>
<p>We will begin exploring a number of concepts relating to electricity as we will essentially be using electrons as our modes of information processing.  From the electrons that flow through a button or distance sensor to be read by the microprocessor to those which supply the power for our motors and servos, we are heavily dependent on electricity.  Before we get into this, we need to go over some very important concepts.  Take out your Raspberry Pi and follow along with the video below.</p>

<b>Rules of this course in regards to electricity:</b>
<ol><li>Always work only with DC electricity, never use AC voltage except for when you plug your Raspberry Pi into the outlet.</li>
<li>Always work on your circuits when the devices are unplugged and batteries removed.  Not only is this a safety issue, it will prevent the need to replace electrical components</li>
<li>Only use the components listed in the laboratory activity on which you are working.  Do not try new components you have never used before or are unfamiliar with.</li>
<li>Keep your work area clean and uncluttered.  Do not keep beverages on your workstation.</li>
</ol>

## Circuits

For the first section of the course, we will begin using our online textbook.  Please keep in mind that, in order to begin using the Raspberry Pi (i.e. receiving the power supply) you will need to pass all of the required quizzes with at least a 70%.

<b>Electrical Circuits</b>

Rather than me trying to do a better job than our textbook, you are going to read the <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-1/electric-circuits/" target="_blank">short section on circuits</a> and complete the <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/worksheets/elementary-circuits/online" target="_blank">worksheet</a>.  These questions will be similar to those that you will see on your unit exam (The one you need at least a 70% on to move on).  So...that means that you are not completing this worksheet for a grade.  Instead, you are trying to measure how well you learned the concepts in the reading.  Much of this year's content will be delivered this way.  Get your head around the idea of learning for the sake of learning.

To help you understand this concept, here is an excellent video from SparkFun Electronics on the topic.
