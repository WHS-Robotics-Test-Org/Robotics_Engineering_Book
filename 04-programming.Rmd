# Python Programming

Finally!  We are going to start learning how to make the Raspberry Pi control components like lights and motors and receive input from sensors.  This is what will make your creations become real robots.  For this unit we will refer to the <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/" target="_blank">course programming text</a> quite often.  Many of the programming problems come from the Downey text as well.  For all of your assignments in this section you will start here though.  Learn the basic concepts of that assignment, read more about it on the course text, go to GitHub Classroom to practice the program and finally, transfer what you have learned to the Raspberry Pi.

Let's get started by setting up the Pi and learning more about Python and it's wide range of applications.

## Setting up the Raspberry Pi

These procedures are for students in the <i>Robotics Engineering</i> course at Windsor High School.  As such, some of the initial steps required in setting up a Raspberry Pi have already been completed.  If you are using a new, out of the box, Pi refer to one of the many tutorials online.

<b>Equipment Needed:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Raspberry Pi 3B+</li>
  <li>5V | 2.5A power supply</li>
  <li>32GB Micro SD card with pre-installed Linux based OS</li>
  <li>Monitor</li>
  <li>HDMI cable</li>
  <li>Keyboard</li>
  <li>Mouse</li>
  <li>Optional: Windows, iOS or Linux Computer (not a Chromebook)</li>
  <li>Connection to a LAN.  In the lab this is "Mechlab".  At home it is your router.</li>
</ul><br>
NOTE: For the initial setup we will use the monitor, keyboard and mouse.  Eventually, we will only use the command line functions which will allow you to eliminate those components and control the Pi from your laptop remotely if you choose.  If not, you can use the Pi as a computer itself but just enter the command line controls of the Linux terminal.  Eventually, you will need to be able to do this though as we will disconnect the Pi from all physical I/O devices and make it the brains of a self-sufficient robotic system.<br>

### Putting the Pi Together

To begin, assemble the Pi by putting the SD card in the slot.  Connect the monitor to the HDMI port, and the keyboard and mouse to the USB ports.  Plug in the power cord and turn it on.<br>

(Create a custom background for the RPi and install all of the programs needed for the class.)

### Controlling the Pi with SSH

For many, it may be easiest just to use the Raspberry Pi as a standalone computer.  In order to do this one just needs to keep the Pi connected to a monitor, keyboard and mouse.  One of the main advantages of this is that one can just turn on the Pi, wait for the boot sequence to finish and start programming using the terminal.  Another advantage is that other programming interfaces may be used such as Notepad++ which has built in code highlighting and markup functions that make programming in Python, and other languages, easier.  More advanced users might even choose to install an interface like PyCharm which has even more functions aimed at enhancing the programming experience and may be connected to Git or an online code repository like GitHub.  Maybe the biggest advantage of programming from the Pi desktop environment is that a web browser may be easily used alongside the command line terminal or programming interface.

Eventually though, we will all need to sever our connection to the peripherals.  Imagine trying to test out a mobile robot system with the monitor still attached.  When we make the switch we start interacting with the Pi through SSH (Secure Shell).  This concept is not as difficult to understand as one might think.  Essentially you are accessing the terminal window for the Pi through another computer using a piece of software like Putty.  When both devices are connected to the same router, this is a fairly simple process.   While we will not require this yet, it is strongly recommended that every student go over this process which is detailed in the section titled [Controlling the Raspberry Pi Remotely] in the last chapter of this book sometime in the first semester.  The Capstone project will require this so we might as well get used to it now.  Most will probably switch back and forth between using the Pi as a desktop computer and accessing it via SSH.

## The parts of the RPi and Pinout

Let's examine the parts of this tiny computer that you will be using for the rest of the year...it is really quite amazing how much can be packed on the small device.

There are several things worth noting here about the Pi:
<ul>
  <li>While it is possible to power the device with a micro USB power supply that provides only 1A of current (older Android phones use this), it is best to use the full 2-2.5A power supply, especially when we start hooking up components to the GPIO pins</li>
  <li>Be careful not to short two GPIO pins together or connect an external DC power supply incorrectly to one of the GPIO pins.  These actions can damage essential components of the Pi.</li>
  <li>TBC</li>
</ul>
<br>
A powerful feature of the Raspberry Pi is the row of GPIO (general-purpose input/output) pins along the top edge of the board.  There are 40 pins which we can use for a wide range of robotics applications.

<br>
It is important to remember which pins are which as the locations do not represent the GPIO labels.  If you forget or cannot find this diagram, use the command line in the terminal.  

This is as good a place as any to start using the terminal.  Before the introduction of the Apple Lisa with a graphical user interface (GUI), all computers used something like the terminal as the interface with humans.  All computers still contain a terminal.  The Raspberry Pi OS we are using is based on the Linux kernel so we will use Linux commands but the procedure is similar for other systems such as Windows and macOS.  With the Raspberry Pi powered on press CTRL+ALT+T to open a terminal session. 


After the terminal opens, type the following command: ```pinout```

You should see something like this in the terminal:

<img src="https://github.com/stcline/Hosted_Images/blob/master/Robotics_Engineering/gpiozero-pinout.png?raw=true">

Any of the GPIO pins can be designated (in software) as an input or output pin and used for a wide range of purposes.  We will use them to send and receive electrical signals.  Two 5V pins and two 3V3 pins are present on the board, as well as a number of ground pins (0V), which are unconfigurable. The remaining pins are all general purpose 3V3 pins, meaning outputs are set to 3V3 and inputs are 3V3-tolerant.

A GPIO pin designated as an output pin can be set to high (3V3) or low (0V).  In addition pins GPIO12, GPIO13, GPIO18, GPIO19 may also be used with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).  A GPIO pin designated as an input pin can be read as high (3V3) or low (0V). This is made easier with the use of internal pull-up or pull-down resistors. Pins GPIO2 and GPIO3 have fixed pull-up resistors, but for other pins this can be configured in software.

It is possible to control GPIO pins using a number of programming languages and tools.  For this course we will use Bash, the scripting language of Linux, and Python.

## Why Python?

It is worth spending a little time discussing the reasons why Python will be the chosen operating system for this course.  Prior to Fall 2020, the course utilized the Arduino UNO as the microprocessor for the robotics systems.  The Arduino is also a versatile, fully programmable microcomputer with input and output pins capable of producing and detecting low DC voltages. It utilizes the C++ programming language.  There were a few limitations, however, with the Arduino UNO.  

The biggest advantage of the Pi is the programming interface.  Since the Pi is essentially a small Linux computer, applications and environments that function on Linux also function on the Pi.  The default scripting language on Linux is called Bash.  When you called up the ```pinout``` for the Raspberry Pi earlier, you were using Bash.  It is a powerful command line interface.  Why not just use Bash instead of learning another language within the Linux shell?  The main reason for this is Python's usefulness outside of this class.  We know from past experience that almost all of our Robotics Engineering students will go on to some kind of technical field of study in college.  While those do not all go in to robotics, they all need to learn new languages.  Python is about the most useful language one can learn in high school if planning to go on to a technical degree in college like engineering, computer science, data science or machine learning as well as almost any natural science field of study.  It is powerful, easy to learn and widely used.  The most recent StackOverflow survey ranked Python 3rd most popular among users.  By learning this language, you will be more prepared to take on the challenges of a field of study in college related to robotics.  Since one of the main objectives of our program is to help students prepare for post-secondary STEM fields of study, Python is an easy choice.

Python is also an interpreted language instead of a compiled language.  What is the difference?  In order to get a compiled language to run on a computer, the additional step of compiling it into machine code must take place before the device will run the commands of the program.  With an interpreted language, a program or virtual machine running on the device (In this case, the Python environment installed on the Raspberry Pi OS) interprets the script written by the programmer directly into machine code.  This is a faster process than running a compiled language like C++.  Other interpreted languages include Ruby, Java and Perl and good old BASIC (Which many of us adult programmers learned when we were younger on our Commodore 64 or Apple IIe computers).  This structure makes Python faster to learn.

There are other advantages to the switch to the Pi.  The first advantage that the Pi has over the UNO is an onboard wireless internet connection.  The Pi can connect to other devices using either 2.4GHz or 5GHz frequencies as well as Bluetooth.  The current version also includes a Power over Ethernet (PoE) capability.  Making the switch to the Raspberry Pi will allow for more seamless IOT (Internet of Things) activities without the need for an additional board.  Second, the Raspberry Pi can actually function like a computer.  We can modify the OS easily by modifying the micro SD card used as RAM on the computer.
